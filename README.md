# agdarsec - Total Parser Combinators in Agda

## Compilation

To typecheck and compile this project you will need:

* Agda version 2.5.2
* Agda's standard library Version 0.13

## Ports

I have ported this library to other dependently-typed languages:

* [parseque](https://github.com/gallais/parseque) is the port to [Coq](https://github.com/coq/coq)
* and [idris-tparsec](https://github.com/gallais/idris-tparsec) the one for [Idris](https://github.com/idris-lang/idris-dev)
